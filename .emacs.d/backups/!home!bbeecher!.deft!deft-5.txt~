ideas for brubeck

bake mongo in at a deeper layer - no more init_db_conn as application code.

either dict shild should have some kind of logic that tells it what kind of db it's going into - mongoDocument or something, 
or brubeck should have the idea db storage mechanisim. Managing connections is no fun :(

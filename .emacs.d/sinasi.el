;;; Commentary:

;; Sinasi Is Not A SproutCore IDE
;;
;; Anything good about Sinasi is the work of Phil Hagelberg and Eric
;; Schulte.  Anything bad is the fault of Eric Kidd.
;;
;; Sinasi is a hacked copy of Rinari, an excellent Emacs toolkit for
;; working with Rails applications.  Sinasi ports a few of the many Rinari
;; features to work with SproutCore applications.  In particular, it allows
;; you to flip between models, unit tests, fixtures, controllers, etc., in
;; a SproutCore source tree.
;;
;; You need to install Rinari and js2.el to get this working,
;; at least for now.  Eventually, I might add support for installing via
;; ELPA.
;;
;; Please feel free to fork this project on github and enhance it.
